# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Random Forest

This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset of real-world-like transaction records. The trained model uses a **Random Forest Classifier** and can predict whether a given transaction is **fraudulent** or **legitimate**.

## 🚀 Features

- Uses a **Random Forest Classifier** for high fraud detection accuracy
- Encodes categorical and date-time features
- Automatically derives **age** and **transaction hour** from DOB and timestamp
- Saves the trained model to a `.pkl` file using `joblib`
- A script to make predictions by taking user input from the terminal

---

## 🔧 Requirements

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib
````

---

## 📊 Dataset Features

The dataset includes the following fields:

* **Inputs**:

  * `cc_num`, `merchant`, `category`, `amt`, `first`, `last`, `gender`, `street`, `city`, `state`, `zip`, `lat`, `long`, `city_pop`, `job`, `unix_time`, `merch_lat`, `merch_long`, `age`, `hour`
* **Output**:

  * `is_fraud` (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraudulent)

---

## 🏗️ How to Train the Model

1. Ensure `fraudTrain.csv` and `fraudTest.csv` are present.
2. Run the training script:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will:

* Train the Random Forest model
* Evaluate it on the test dataset
* Save the model as `fraud_model.pkl`

---

## 🧪 How to Use the Model for Prediction

1. Make sure `fraud_model.pkl` is present.
2. Run the prediction script:

```bash
python predict_fraud_from_input.py
```

3. Enter transaction details when prompted.
4. The script will predict if the transaction is **fraudulent** or **legitimate**.

---

## 📌 Notes

* Input fields like `dob` and `trans_date_trans_time` are used to derive useful features like `age` and `hour`.
* Categorical values are factorized during prediction (not ideal for production). In real use cases, consistent LabelEncoders should be saved and reused.

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Save and reuse LabelEncoders for consistent categorical encoding
* Add web interface using Flask/Django
* Support batch prediction from CSV files
* Include feature importance plots for interpretability
